# 3D Contour

3D contour displays a three-dimensional plot of a set of data points connected via a line. This should not be confused with the 2D line graph because in 2D line graph one of the axes is always ordered which is not the case with 3D contour. 

This can be used to plot a motion of an object in three dimensional space or can also be used to visualize pathlines or streamline like the flow of wind around a plane wing. Multiple lines can be grouped with each other to be compared to one another.

## Pros and Cons of 3D Contour

__Pros__
* Motion of an object in 3D space can be easily visualized like flight of a bird

__Cons__
* Grouping multiple lines can cause clutter and confusion
* If one of the axes is ordered it could to be harder to interpret which axes is ordered

## Interactivity in VR to Enhance the Information

* Animation can be used to visualize motion in space
