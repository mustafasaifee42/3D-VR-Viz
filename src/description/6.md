# 3D Bubble Chart

Bubble chart is a variation of scatter plot; bubble chart are scatter plots with point size representing a quantitative data type and color representing a categorical data type. 3D bubble chart generally visualizes four-dimensional data; although additional data can be visualized using colours. _2D bubble charts gained popularity after Hans Rosling's TED 2006 talk on human development trends._

## Pros and Cons of 3D Bubble Chart

__Pros__
* An additional data type is visualized using the size of the point
* Easy to understand
* Easy to identify correlations, clusters, patterns, outliers, and trends in the dataset

__Cons__
* Because of the depth perception; the size of the point can be misinterpreted
* Different shapes cannot not be used for point as it is hard to compares sizes of different shapes
* For a larger dataset, the plot can get cluttered and messy
* Overlapping data point can cause occlusion (opacity can be used to solve this problem)
* Aspect ratio of the graph can greatly affect the interpretation of the data 

## Interactivity in VR to Enhance the Information

* Adding droplines can help in visualizing the position of points in space
* Adding projections of the points in different planes help in visualizing correlations between bivariate data
* Animation can be used to add a time as an additional dimension
