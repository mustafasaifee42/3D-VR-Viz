# 3D Bar Chart on Map

Bar Chart on Map is simply a combination of a bar chart and a map; with the bars placed on the location whose value they represent. Like a bar chart, the height of each bar is scaled to represent a quantitative data. The map could be a map of the world, a country, city or even a spatial map of a room.

If the map used is planar projection then the map should be placed on the __xz plane__ i.e. the floor and the bars should rise on the __y axes__.

## What your data should look like to use 3D Bar Chart on Map

Location / Country | Value 
:-------------:| :-----:|  
Location 1 | 8 
Location 2 | 20 
Location 3 | 32 
Location 4 | 44 

## Pros and Cons of 3D Bar Chart on Map

__Pros__
* It is a great tool to combine geospatial data with quantitative data
* In VR the user can walk around on the map and because of infinitely big canvas size the map could be of a very large size
* In case of the map of the room actual dimensions can be used

__Cons__
* Maps get hidden if there is a high density of bars
* Smaller countries and bars can be hidden behind larger bars
* If the map used is a globe; it gets harder to compare the height of the bars coming out of the bars

## Variations

* Choropleth map with bars chart
* Map with stacked bar chart
