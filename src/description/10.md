# 3D Flow Map

Flow Map is simply a combination of a flow diagram or sankey daigram and a map which visualizes movement of an object or many object from one location to another. If the flow of an object is not a straight line like migration of the birds it can also be seen as a combination 3D contour and a map.

If the map used is planar projection then the map should be placed on the __xz plane__.

## Visualization of Additional Datatype in Flow Map

* __Stroke width__ or __width__ of the flow can be used to display a how much of object is tranferred
* __Colour__ of the flow can be used to display an categorical data of the flow; for example colour an be used to visualize if a flow is inflow or outflow
* __Height__ of the flow can be used to visualize addition data; for example while visualizing the flow of flights, we can visualize the actual flying height of the flights using the height of the flow

## Pros and Cons of 3D Bar Chart

__Pros__
* Easy to identify relationship between different geographical region
* Good to identify high density and low density zones

__Cons__
* Flows can overlap and increase clutter
* While using a globe the height of the flow is harder to compare

## Interactivity in VR to Enhance the Information

* Instead of width, __animation__ can be used to visualize the how much of object is tranferred; faster the animation more object is tranferred (this can help reduce the clutter in the map)

## Variations

* 3D Contour Map (combination of 3D contour and map)
