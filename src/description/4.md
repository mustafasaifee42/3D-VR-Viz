# 3D Point Cloud

A point cloud is a set of points in a coordinate system; hence 3D point cloud is set of point in 3D coordinate system. 

Traditionally point cloud in 3D coordinate system have been used to visualize the external surface of an object; but in data visualization it can also be used to visualize point or position of object in space.

## Input

 x | y | z | 
:-------------:| :-----:| :-----:| 
4 | 8 | 12
16 | 20 | 24
28 | 32 | 36
40 | 44 | 48

## Visualization of Additional Datatype in Point Cloud

* __Size__ of the point can be used to display a quantitative attribute of the object
* __Colour__ of the point can be used to display an aditional quantitative or cetegorical attribute of the object
* __3D model__ of the object can be used insted of a point or sphere or random shape

_One of the common application of point cloud in data visualization is for creating a map of stars and planets and to identify their orbits._

## Pros and Cons of 3D Point Cloud

__Pros__
* Easy to understand as position attribute is used to represent the position
* It is great to identifing clusters

__Cons__
* It can look clutters if the data set is big
* The point in the front can hide the point at the back
