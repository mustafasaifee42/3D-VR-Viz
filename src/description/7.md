# 3D Connected Scatterplot

A connected scatterplot is a combination scatter plot and line graph/contour. 3D connected scatterplot maps three values onto a 3D Cartesian plane, with one time
series represented on the __x axes__, the other on the __y__ and another on the __z axes__. A line is drawn to connect the points in temporal order. 2D version of connected scatter plot is mostly used in journalism and one of its first use in news graphics was [Oilâ€™s Roller Coaster Ride by Amanda Cox for The New York Times in February 2008](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/02/19/business/20080220_CENTURY_GRAPHIC.html?src=tp).

Connected scatterplots can contain two particularly interesting features: __L-shapes__ and __loops__.
* __L-shape__ feature represents sudden changes in the relationship between the three time series; for example, an L appears when one variable remains constant while the others are changing or when two variable remains constant while the other is changing.
* __Loops__ occur whenever a local peak and valley pair (local maxima and local minima) occurs at different times in each series.

_A connected scatterplot can only be drawn when the time series are sampled at the same rate; for example, all the time series should be sampled yearly._

2000 | 4 | 8 | 12

## Pros and Cons of 3D Contour

__Pros__
* It is great to identify correlations between multiple time series
* L-shape and loops can help give insights which otherwise would be really hard to notice

__Cons__
* It a novel visualization so might require some time for the user to understand
* Sometimes connected scatterplot can create complex shapes that can be hard to interpret
* If arrows are missing; it might be harder for the user to figure out the order and direction
* The importance of L-shapes and loops might not be evident to the user
