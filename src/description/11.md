# Waterfall Plot

Waterfall Plot is a three-dimensional plot in which multiple curves of data are displayed at the same time. Typically waterfall plot is often used to show how two-dimensional information changes over time with the first curve being the most recent one. Instead of time, some other variable can also be used.

_This plot is most commonly and frequently used in spectral and frequency analysis._

## Pros and Cons of 3D Contour

__Pros__
* Peaks appear to be side by side which help in identifying interesting spectral values

__Cons__
* The curves in the front masks the ones behind it
