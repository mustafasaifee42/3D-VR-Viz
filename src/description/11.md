# 3D Flow Map

Flow Map is simply a combination of a flow diagram or Sankey diagram and a map which visualizes the movement of an object or many different objects from one location to another. If the flow of an object is not a straight line like the migration of the birds it can also be seen as a combination 3D contour and a map.

If the map used is planar projection then the map should be placed on the __xz plane__.

## What your data should look like to use 3D Flow Map

## Visualization of Additional Datatype in Flow Map

* __Stroke width__ or __width__ of the flow can be used to display a how much of object is transferred
* __Colour__ of the flow can be used to display a categorical data of the flow; for example, colour can be used to visualize if a flow is an inflow or outflow
* __Height__ of the flow can be used to visualize addition data; for example, while visualizing the flow of flights, we can visualize the actual flying height of the flights using the height of the flow

## Pros and Cons of 3D Flow Map

__Pros__
* Easy to identify relationships between different geographical regions
* Good to identify high density and low-density zones

__Cons__
* Flows can overlap and increase clutter
* While using a globe the height of the flow is harder to compare

## Interactivity in VR to Enhance the Information

* Instead of width, __animation__ can be used to visualize the how much of object is transferred; faster the animation more objects are transferred (this can help to reduce the clutter on the map)

## Variations

* 3D Contour Map (combination of 3D contour and map can be used for example to show movements in birds in the air)
