# 3D Graph Drawing

In graph theory in mathematics, a graph is a structure formed by vertices and edges; where vertices represent a set of objects and edges represent the relationship between these objects. Graph are mostly used to visualize relationships (e.g. social networks). Visualizing a graph can help identify hidden relationships and interesting patterns.

## Input

## Visualization of Additional Datatype in Graph Drawing

* __Size__ of the vertices can be used to display a quantitative attribute of the node
* __Colour__ of the vertices can be used to display an aditional norminal or ordinal attribute of node
* __Width__ of the edges can be used to display a quantitative attribute of the link
* __Colour__ of the edges can be used to display an aditional norminal or ordinal attribute of the link

## Pros and Cons of 3D Graph Drawing

__Pros__
* Good to visualize relationship
* In VR because of infinite amount of space can help in reducing cluttering

__Cons__
* Different drawing algorithm can effect the interpretation
* Can look cluttered if the amount of node and edges are large

## Interactivity in VR to Enhance the Information

* Zooming can help in viewing the overview
* Highlighting only the related nodes and edges on mouseover on a specific node can help in highlighting and identifying relationships
