# 3D Pictorial Unit Chart

Pictorial unit charts uses icons or 3D objects to display the data, with each icon representing a certain value for a paricular category. For example, to represent number of cars in an area; we can use 3D object of the car to visualize the value.

The advantage of Pictorial unit charts in VR is that we can have one to one mapping even for large numbers as we have the luxury of space; therefore enhancing the perception of the data. The use of 3D object can help overcome differences in language, culture and education.
