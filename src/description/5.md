# 3D Scatter Plot

Scatter plots are plots or diagrams which visualizes quantitative data as sets of points (these points can be any shape) in space. 3D scatter plots generally visualizes three-dimensional data; although additional data can be visualized using colours, shapes of the dot etc.

Scatter plots are one of the most common forms of visualization, and they are widely used in scientific visualization. They are mostly used to find correlations, clusters, patterns, outliers, and trends in the dataset. 

## Input

 x | y | z | 
:-------------:| :-----:| :-----:| 
4 | 8 | 12
16 | 20 | 24
28 | 32 | 36
40 | 44 | 48

## Pros and Cons of 3D Scatter Plot

__Pros__
* Easy to understand
* Easy to identify correlations, clusters, patterns, outliers, and trends in the dataset
* Additional characteristics of the points (like colours, shapes, and textures) can be used to visualize additional categorical data

__Cons__
* For a larger dataset, the plot can get cluttered and messy
* Overlapping data point can cause occlusion (opacity can be used to solve this problem)
* Aspect ratio of the graph can greatly affect the interpretation of the data 

## Interactivity in VR to Enhance the Information

* Adding droplines can help in visualizing the position of points in space
* Adding projections of the points in different planes help in visualizing correlations between bivariate data
* Animation can be used to add a time as an additional dimension
