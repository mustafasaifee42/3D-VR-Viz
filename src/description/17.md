# Prism Map

Prism Map is a three-dimensional map that uses height to indicate a single value data field. Prism maps are created using region layers; with the height of the region raised according to the data value.

## What your data should look like to use Prism Map

Country/Region | Value 
:-------------:| :-----:|  
Region 1 | 8 
Region 2 | 20 
Region 3 | 32 
Region 4 | 44 

## Pros and Cons of Prism Map

__Pros__
* Good for identifying trend on a map
* Good for identifying outliers on a map

__Cons__
* Requires a significant amount of memory and time
* Occlusion is caused because of overlapping regions (opacity can be used to solve this problem)

## Interactivity in VR to Enhance the Information

* Animation can be used to visualize the change over time
