This is a 3D Stacked Bars plot with bar shape set to Cylinder. The plot tracks emissions of three classes of greenhouse gases; in the countries of France Germany Canada and Japan over the period from 1990 to 2010.

# 3D Stacked Bar Chart

Stacked Bar charts are a variation of bar charts; where bars that represent different data type are stacked on top of each other. The height of the resulting bar shows the combined result of the groups.  _Stacked bar graphs present the information in the same sequence on each bar._

## What your data should look like to use 3D Stacked Bar Chart 

| | Category 1 | Category 2 | Category 3 | Category 4
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| :-----:| :-----:|
Category A | `i:`4,`j:`4 | `i:`8,`j:`8 | `i:`12,`j:`12 | `i:`16,`j:`16
Category B | `i:`20,`j:`20 | `i:`24,`j:`24 | `i:`28,`j:`28 | `i:`32,`j:`32
Category C | `i:`36,`j:`36 | `i:`40,`j:`40 | `i:`44,`j:`44 | `i:`48,`j:`48
Category D | `i:`52,`j:`52 | `i:`56,`j:`56 | `i:`60,`j:`60 | `i:`64,`j:`64

## Pros and Cons of 3D Stacked Bar Chart

__Pros__
* Gives an overview of the data
* Easy to understand due to widespread use in business and the media
* Percentage Distribution for the third data type can easily be seen of a single bar

__Cons__
* Occlusion is caused because of overlapping bars (opacity can be used to solve this problem)
* Difficult to compare all but bottom (the first) segment of the bars
* Becomes more complex when the number of segments increases
* If not drawn with care the 3D version could look very cluttered
