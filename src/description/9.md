# 3D Graph Drawing

In graph theory in mathematics, a graph is a structure formed by vertices and edges; where vertices represent a set of objects and edges represent the relationship between these objects. Graph Drawings are mostly used to visualize relationships (e.g. social networks). Visualizing a graph can help identify hidden relationships and interesting patterns.

## What your data should look like to use 3D Graph Drawing 

| | Node 1 | Node 2 | Node 3 | Node 4
:-------------:| :-----:| :-----:|:-----:| :-----:| 
Node 1 |  | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ 
Node 2 | ✔ |  |  | |
Node 3 | ✔ |  |  | ✔
Node 4 | ✔ |  | ✔ | |

## Visualization of Additional Datatype in Graph Drawing

* __Size__ of the vertices can be used to display a quantitative attribute of the noded
* __Colour__ of the vertices can be used to display an additional nominal or ordinal attribute of the nodes
* __Width__ of the edges can be used to display a quantitative attribute of the link
* __Colour__ of the edges can be used to display an additional nominal or ordinal attribute of the link

## Pros and Cons of 3D Graph Drawing

__Pros__
* Good for visualizing relationships
* In VR because of an unlimited amount of space can help in reducing cluttering

__Cons__
* Different drawing algorithm can affect the interpretation
* Can look cluttered if the amount of node and edges are large

## Interactivity in VR to Enhance the Information

* Zooming can help in viewing the overview
* Highlighting only the related nodes and edges on mouseover on a specific node can help in highlighting and identifying relationships
