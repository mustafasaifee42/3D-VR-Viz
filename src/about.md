# About the Project

3D-VR-Viz is a project developed by [Mustafa Saifee](http://mustafasaifee.com/) to create a library and reusable react component of 3D VR data visualization.

This project is done as a part of my master thesis in Visual Communication Design at [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/en/). 

Although, there are a few websites which catalogue different kinds of data visualization; [The Data Visualisation Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com) and [Data Viz Project](http://datavizproject.com/) the most popular of them; they mostly focus on 2D data visualization techniques (some examples do have a few 3D visualizations). In this website; I mainly focus on 3D visualizations and how and where they can be used.

I have done a basic research about each visualization methods and tried to explain these methods here.

Since its a personal project I would like to hear your feedback. Please [let me know](mailto:saifee.mustafa@gmail.com) if you find any errors, issues, suggestions for the website or if you would like me to add a new visualization method. I would love to hear what you think.
