# 3D-VR-Viz
Catalogue of 3D data visualization

This catalouges different kind 3D data visualizations that can be used in AR or VR. You can visit the catalouge [here](https://vr-3d-viz.herokuapp.com/). If you have any feedback or if I have missed any 3D visualization (which I am sure I have), do let me know 

Although, there are a few websites which catalogue different kinds of data visualization; [The Data Visualisation Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) and [Data Viz Project](http://datavizproject.com/) the most popular of them; they mostly focus on 2D data visualization techniques (some examples do have a few 3D visualizations). In this website; here I mainly focus on 3D visualizations and how and where they can be used.
